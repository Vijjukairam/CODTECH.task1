OVERVEIW OF THE PROJECT {TASK1}
1. Data Loading and Cleaning:

You can achieve data loading similarly using pandas.read_csv if the Iris dataset was in CSV format.
2. Data Overview:

Instead of separate print statements, you can use .head() and .tail() methods of the DataFrame to view the first and last few rows for a quick glimpse.
3. Feature Distribution Visualization:

You can use matplotlib.pyplot.hist to create histograms for each feature.
Alternatively, consider using violin plots with seaborn.violinplot to show the distribution and potential density variations within each species.
4. Relationship Exploration:

While pairplots are great for an overview, you can create individual scatter plots using plt.scatter to focus on specific feature combinations suggested by the correlation heatmap.
5. Correlation Analysis:

The approach using corr.heatmap with annotations is effective. You can explore alternative colormaps like bwr (blue-white-red) for highlighting both positive and negative correlations.
6. Outlier Detection:

You can use df.boxplot() to create boxplots directly on the DataFrame, although customization might be limited compared to seaborn.boxplot.
7. Missing Value Check:

The approach using df.isnull().sum() is efficient.
8. Species Distribution:
